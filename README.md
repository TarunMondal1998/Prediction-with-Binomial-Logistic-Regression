# Prediction-with-Binomial-Logistic-Regression
Prediction of Client Status in banking using Logistic Regression
## Overview:
This project aimed to predict whether the client (bank’s customer) has subscribed to a term deposit based on demographic attributes and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using Logistic regression model.
## Methodology:
The primary motive of this study is to accurately predict the subscription status of baking customers (yes or no) based on different demographic attributes (such as age, gender, marital status, and location) as well as marketing strategies. The target variable in this project is a categorical variable, which has two different categories (‘yes’ and ‘no’), due to this classification algorithms can be considered as suitable for this project. Additionally, due to the binary nature of the target variable, the Logistic regression model has opted for this study, which has been developed, trained and evaluated using Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook IDE.
## Language and tool:
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
